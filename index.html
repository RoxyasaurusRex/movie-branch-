  <h1>Into the wild</h1> 
  <h2>-Drama-  -Biography-  -Adventure-  (2007)</h2>
  <p>Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless 
    had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like 
    those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave 
    Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, 
    and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander 
    Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free 
    to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. 
    Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps. 
    Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.</p>
